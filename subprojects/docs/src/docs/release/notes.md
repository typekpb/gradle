## Upgrade instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle @version@ by updating your wrapper:

`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=@version@`

See the [Gradle 7.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_7.html#changes_@baseVersion@) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle @version@. 

For Java, Groovy, Kotlin and Android compatibility, see the [full compatibility notes](userguide/compatibility.html).

## New features and usability improvements

<!-- Do not add breaking changes or deprecations here! Add them to the upgrade guide instead. -->

### FILL-IN-KEY-AREA improvements

<<<FILL IN CONTEXT FOR KEY AREA>>>
Example:
> The [configuration cache](userguide/configuration_cache.html) improves build performance by caching the result of
> the configuration phase. Using the configuration cache, Gradle can skip the configuration phase entirely when
> nothing that affects the build configuration has changed.

#### FILL-IN-FEATURE
> HIGHLIGHT the usecase or existing problem the feature solves
> EXPLAIN how the new release addresses that problem or use case
> PROVIDE a screenshot or snippet illustrating the new feature, if applicable
> LINK to the full documentation for more details

### JVM toolchains improvements

[Java toolchains](userguide/toolchains.html) provide an easy way to declare which Java version your project should be built with.
By default, Gradle will [detect installed JDKs](userguide/toolchains.html#sec:auto_detection) or automatically download new toolchain versions.

#### Changes following migration from AdoptOpenJDK to Adoptium

Following the migration of [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) to [Eclipse Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/), a number of changes have been made for toolchains:
* `ADOPTIUM` and `IBM_SEMERU` are now recognized as vendors,
* Both of the above can be used as vendors and trigger auto-provisioning,
* Using `ADOPTOPENJDK` as a vendor and having it trigger auto-provisioning will emit a [deprecation warning](userguide/upgrading_version_7.html#adoptopenjdk_download).

See [the documentation](userguide/toolchains.html#sec:provisioning) for details.

### Kotlin DSL improvements

#### Type-safe accessors for extensions of `repositories {}`

The Kotlin DSL now generates type-safe model accessors for extensions registered on the `repositories {}` block.


For example, starting with this version of Gradle, the [`asciidoctorj-gems-plugin`](https://asciidoctor.github.io/asciidoctor-gradle-plugin/master/user-guide/#asciidoctorj-gems-plugin) can be configured directly via the generated type-safe accessors:


```kotlin
repositories {
    ruby {
        gems()
    }
}
```

Whereas before it required to use [`withGroovyBuilder`]():

```kotlin
repositories {
    withGroovyBuilder {
        "ruby" {
            "gems"()
        }
    }
}
```

or, required more tinkering in order to discover what names and types to use, relying on the API:
```kotlin
repositories {
    this as ExtensionAware
    configure<com.github.jrubygradle.api.core.RepositoryHandlerExtension> {
        gems()
    }
}
```
See [the documentation](userguide/kotlin_dsl.html#type-safe-accessors) for details.

### Dependency verification improvements

[Dependency verification](userguide/dependency_verification.html) is a feature that allows build to verify the checksums and signatures of the plugins and dependencies that are used by your project.

With this release, the generation of the dependency verification file has been improved to produce stable output.
This allows you to leverage generation as an update strategy for the verification metadata when dependencies change in your project.
Have a look at [the documentation](userguide/dependency_verification.html#sec:verification-update) for more details.
